TODO list
=========

For 1.1.0 release
=================

- update license and authorship in all files
- test versions and converter
- uniformize docs, write examples as doctest
- profile and compare with 1.0, stress test on big data
- rename write as push and document it's behavior

For a future release
====================

- Have a h5features.File class inspired by h5py.File


General TODOs
=============

- Examples on how to extend h5features to custom datasets
  (i.e. Dataset inheritance).
- Examples of equivalence between legacy and new APIs.
- Refactor the Reader _get_items, _get_times methods. This is not
  clear at all what the point is.
